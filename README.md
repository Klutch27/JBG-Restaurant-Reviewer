This project was created by Josie Beaudoin, Billy Tran, and Gareth Leake.
This program was created as our final project for Codesmith's CS Prep program in June of 2019.
It was written in vanilla Javascipt, and utilizes window prompting as a way to engage the user.
There are various in-line comments that seek to explain each portion of code.
The comments also note some areas of difficulty, and propose possible areas of expansion.

Thanks for checking out our project!
